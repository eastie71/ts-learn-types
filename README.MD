# Typescript Learning - Types Examples
See **src/types** folder for files with examples of different types. You can copy the contents of any of these files into "index.ts" to try them out.

- You will need node/npm installed
- Install typescript - go to typescriptlang.com - suggest to install globally
- Run tsc --init (to create the config file "tsconfig.json")
- Run "npm install"
- Use "npm start" to have auto TS compiler running.
